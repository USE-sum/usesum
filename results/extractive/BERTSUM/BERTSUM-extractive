ideal , near city centre , good all round hotel , strangely only on 7th & 8th floor of pictured building notwithstanding the sheer unprofessional and unreliable attitude of their taxi partner !<q>interesting layout being on the 7th and 8th floor .<q>so to ramada is more important to please their business partners instead of pleasing their customers !

just the basics for a good breakfast ( not a huuuge selection if you ’re a non - egg - eating vegetarian like me though ! ) 
although the public areas of the hotels are impressive , the rooms at the express are the equivalent of a motel 6 , meaning very small , cramped , no closets or drawers , no clocks , no shampoo or conditioner , and limited coffee / tea service 
my room was okay except i did not enjoy the tv channels 
good location , and good value , though you get what you pay for

the hotel is in a quiet area close to metro and rue de cler 
lovely , spacious apartment in quiet area but close enough to the historic centre to walk to everything 
the staff was welcoming and helpful with anything you would need 
breakfast area is outdoors by the pool enclosed in a tent with very small area and few tables to accommodate   the guests 
this hotel is located in muswell hill and not alexandra palace , which is a bonus as the shops and restautants etc are all in muswell hill 
the condo is much bigger than we were expecting and everything is perfectly maintained and clean !<q>the marina inn is my favorite hotel in myrtle beach and i highly recommend it to those seeking that perfect hideaway with someone special ... we enjoyed everything about the hotel but the waterview that i was promised was a lie although you can go down to lobby for complimentary coffee ) 
called for the airport shuttle and had to wait 20 minutes ( shuttle driver was a nice guy ) 
steps from the alamo , the homewood suites by hilton san antonio riverwalk downtown offers modern , family friendly accommodations in a historic building overlooking the water .<q>many popular restaurants , including bella on the river and biga on the banks , are steps away .<q>we played games in the living room part of the room with 6 people , plenty of seating !
the sinks do n't drain , the a / c did n't work , the showers were nuts and the tvs do n't work in all the rooms 
the air conditioner seemed to quit and the room temp got hot / humid 
this is fine except glossed over in the intro at the check - in so our friends could n't figure out why their tv did n't work , and we came home to a hot room because the ac turned off when we left the room and took the key card 
we survived but had i known we ’d have brought our own water 
cheep   shuttle will take you to the orleans and the main strip every half hour ... the casino is not bad and the buffet is good and very affordable if you 're looking for a affordable hotel off the strip it 's not a bad place to stay ... very good for familes and groups as it is not the largest in vegas so you can find your group pretty quickly 
room was great , the only thing that was a bummer is the hotel bar/ restaurant closed at 11 on a saturday ...... i want to let the hotel 1000 staff know how grateful we were during our stay

hotel clean and staff friendly , a 4 stop underground from city centre , 3 single adults stopping for 3 nights room clean and tidy , bathroom is small as we were all large adults not much room to dry off after having shower 
it was bearable for one night but as my title says , i will not stay there again 
the only complaint was the wifi signal in our room was very poor 
i said it all in the title to this review 
the room smelled like it had been empty for a long time and the bathroom was just nasty 
they need to give these rooms a thorough cleaning with bleach and a vacuum 
we were required to pre - book it however , at no time , we were asked if we had any food allergies in order to ensure that all guest can enjoy the ‘ set menu : this was rather difficult as one of us is dairy intolerant and therefor this is a rather unusual set - up for a 5 stars hotel 
the motel style building is perfect for lots of comings and goings 
very friendly and accommodating staff both at check in and check out

when i pointed out that the hotel advertised a fitness center ( there is actually a picture of one in the orbitz photos of the hotel ) and that we should be refunded the 10 euros x 2 people x 3 days , the staff was rude and apathetic 
the hotel is in a great location and is beautiful with an incredibly friendly staff

the room doors is the only complaint is have , they slam very hard 
upon investigating to see what was up , i realized that the window ( behind the curtain ) had been duct taped shut 
i will never book again thru you unless we get a whole refund 
the curtains were old and the bed was a little springy 
the hotel was very nice and clean and all the staff was very friendly 
great breakfast selection that was well staffed when guests depleted it 
a kid   three years and under can stay free of charge 
i would never of booked this if i was told this before hand 
what i see as a problem is only it is sometimes difficult to find out 
this hotel was great for families , with a fantastic view of the beach 
this hotel is in one of the best locations for exploring the city 
convenient to grab something quick to eat and drink , or sit - down restaurants as well if you like finer food

to make matters worse , all the restaurants and dining places nearby were already closed ( ~6pm ) and we had to settle for snacks from the nearby convenience stores 
we were fortunate to secure a room at the astor and even better , after our first night we moved to a suite 
the louvre , notre dame , and the champs elysees are within two miles of the hotel 
the hotel was quite basic but was in a good location 
close and comfortable at a great price and it you are not afraid of walking it is close enough to walk to tourist places about 20 min away my husband and i had stayed here twice before and therefore had no hesitation to book again for our recent trip to spain with a group of 5 other friends 
would of liked to be nearer food places within walking distance 2.5 out of 5 definately areas of improvement to be made 
the hotel although a little bit from town is very close to macdonalds and next door to the hungry horse so cheap dining and child friendly places are near by the hungry horse has quite popular play area for kids but the hotel is nice and sedate 
when i went to check in 
a wonderful relaxing stay in a beautiful area 
bus to the hotel zone can be hopped on right outside this hotel 
loved the hotel but not a great area for bars or restaurants the location is great - a minute walk to the s - bahn and a short walk to many of berlin 's most famous attractions 
when i questioned the desk clerk , they said their phones were down but the shuttle was out running around 
an okay stay at a marriott , have stayed at better hotels in nyc 
the only advice i have is an extra set of pillows 
it would have been nicer to have tea coffee facility in my room 
great value for money , especially a young family .<q>3 nights was enough to feel relaxed during our travels around menorca .<q>great reception staff , good star to lorenzo !
the beds were n't comfortable but for location to mall and grande ole opryland it was good 
only thing i got placed on the floor with the dog owners 
many restaurants are located close by the dining pleasure of guests
